# Insight.Database #

**Insight.Database** is a fast, lightweight, (and dare we say awesome) micro-orm for .NET. It's available as a [NuGet Package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Insight.Database/).

Whoops. Forgot to mention easy. It's easy too. And you can also take control of pieces if you want to.

Let's say you have a database and a class and you want them to work together. Something like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Beer ([ID] [int], [Type] varchar(128), [Description] varchar(128)) GO
CREATE PROC InsertBeer @type varchar(128), @description varchar(128) AS
	INSERT INTO Beer (Type, Description) OUTPUT inserted.ID
		VALUES (@type, @description) GO
CREATE PROC GetBeerByType @type [varchar] AS SELECT * FROM Beer WHERE Type = @type GO
```
```c#
public class Beer
{
	public int ID { get; private set; }
	public string Type { get; set; }
	public string Description { get; set; }
}

	var beer = new Beer() { Type = "ipa", Description = "Sly Fox 113" };
```

Let's get Insight.Database:

	PM> Install-Package Insight.Database

If you have a database other than SqlServer, use one of the alternate provider packages:

```
	PM> Install-Package Insight.Database.Providers.Postgres
```

Now, wire up those stored procedures to an interface with a single `connection.As<T>`:

```c#
public interface IBeerRepository
{
	void InsertBeer(Beer beer);
	IList<Beer> GetBeerByType(string type);
	void UpdateBeerList(IList<Beer> beerList);
}

var repo = connection.As<IBeerRepository>();

repo.InsertBeer(beer);
IList<Beer> beerList = repo.GetBeerByType("ipa");
repo.UpdateBeerList(beerList);
```

Look, ma! No mapping code! (Plus, you can now inject that interface with a DI framework or mock the interface for testing.)

Want to work at a lower level? Let's call a stored proc with an anonymous object. (It also automatically opens and closes the connection.)

```c#
// auto open/close
conn.Execute("AddBeer", new { Name = "IPA", Flavor = "Bitter"});
```

Objects are mapped automatically. No config files, no attributes. Just pure, clean magic:

```c#
// auto object mapping
Beer beer = new Beer();
conn.Execute("InsertBeer", beer);
List<Beer> beers = conn.Query<Beer>("FindBeer", new { Name = "IPA" });
```

Yes, even nested objects. Insight will just figure it out for you:

```c#
// auto object graphs
var servings = conn.Query<Serving, Beer, Glass>("GetServings");
foreach (var serving in servings)
	Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", serving.Beer.Name, serving.Glass.Ounces);
```

Feel free to return multiple result sets. We can handle them:

```c#
// multiple result sets
var results = conn.QueryResults<Beer, Chip>("GetBeerAndChips", new { Pub = "Fergie's" }));
IList<Beer> beer = results.Set1;
IList<Chip> chips = results.Set2;
```

Or perhaps you want to return multiple independent recordsets, with one-to-many and one-to-one relationships. It's not possible! Or is it?

```c#
var results = conn.Query("GetLotsOfStuff", parameters,
	Query.Returns(OneToOne<Beer, Glass>.Records)
		.ThenChildren(Some<Napkin>.Records)
		.Then(Some<Wine>.Records));
var beer = results.Set1;
var glass = beer.Glass;
var napkins = beer.Napkins.ToList();
var wine = results.Set2;
```

But...but how? To that, I say: it's magic! Insight can decode the records and figure out one-to-one and parent-child relationships automatically. Almost all the time, it does this with no work or configuration on your part. But if you have a wacky model, there are plenty of non-scary ways to tell Insight how to work with your data. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/jonwagner/Insight.Database/wiki) for details.

Full async support. Just add `Async`:

```c#
var task = c.QueryAsync<Beer>("FindBeer", new { Name = "IPA" });
```

Send whole lists of objects to databases that support table parameters. No more multiple queries or weird parameter mapping:

```sql
-- auto table parameters
CREATE TYPE BeerTable (Name [nvarchar](256), Flavor [nvarchar](256))
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertBeer (@BeerList [BeerTable])
```
```c#
List<Beer> beerList = new List<Beer>();
conn.Execute("InsertBeer", new { BeerList = beerList });
```

Insight can also stream objects over your database's BulkCopy protocol. 

```c#
// auto bulk-copy objects
IEnumerable<Beer> beerList; // from somewhere
conn.BulkCopy("Beer", beerList);
```

Oh, wait. You want to inline your SQL. We do that too. Just add Sql.

```c#
var beerList = conn.QuerySql<Beer>("SELECT * FROM Beer WHERE Name LIKE @Name", new { Name = "%ipa%" });
conn.ExecuteSql ("INSERT INTO Beer VALUES (ID, Name)", beer);
```

Seriously, everything just works automatically. But if you *really* want to control every aspect of mapping, see the [wiki](https://github.com/jonwagner/Insight.Database/wiki).
